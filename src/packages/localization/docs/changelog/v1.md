## 1.0.0
* The notes below are relative to implementation when the APIs are part of `@glyph-cat/swiss-army-knife`.
* Helper type `IDictionary` has been renamed to `IDictionaryData`.
* `LocalizationContext` is now replaced by a less complex equivalent â€” `LocalizedDictionary`.
  * `.tryLocalize` and `.autoSetLanguage` has been removed.
  * `.localize` now only throws a `LocalizationKeyNotFoundError` if the localization key does not exist at all in the entire dictionary (all languages considered). Instead, it is strongly advised to write a test to ensure all localized values are populated correctly. This allows for a more lenient/frictionless dev experience while ensuring that missing localizations would be identified before deploying to production. Please refer to [the recommended test recipe](https://github.com/glyph-cat/swiss-army-knife/blob/main/src/~services/localization/index.test.ts).
* In `LocalizationKeyNotFoundError`, the second parameter (`language`) is now an optional parameter.
* State management logic has been removed, along with hook `useLocalization`.
