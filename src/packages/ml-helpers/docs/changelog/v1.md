## v1.2
* Vision analyzer classes have been partially re-written.
* The main change under the hood is that the landmarker options can be defined in the constructors and the created task runner instances are cached based on the options. This strategy is still necessary and `taskRunner.close()` is also not invoked when calling `.dispose()` because it still results in memory leakage.
* It is also advisable to implement code so that there will only be a maximum of one task runner for each landmarker type throughout the entire app's lifecycle.

## v1.1.3
* Added displayName to vision analyzers for debugging.

## v1.1.2
* Vision analyzer `.dispose` method now gracefully waits for initialization.

## v1.1.1
* Added release tags to exported items.

## v1.1.0
* Added analyzer classes for: body pose, hand pose, hand gesture.
* Replacement constant for `HAND_CONNECTIONS` from `'@mediapipe/hands'`.
* Experimental `ComplexHandGesture` that allows defining finger curl and check if given set of hand landmarks fulfill the hand gesture. This is limited to the accuracy of mediapipe's model.

## v1.0.0
* The initial release.
