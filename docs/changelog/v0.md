    * Examples:
      * Tabbed or paginated navigation.
      * Different steps of the same wizard.
      * A static toolbar or sidebar that is always visible, but listens for keystrokes when it is in focus.
    * APIs:
      * `<CoreNavigationBranch>`
      * `<CoreNavigationBranchItem>`
      * `useCoreNavigationBranch()`
* Removed `FocusableView`, this should be implemented manually based on whether a Navigation Stack or Navigation Branch is better suited.

  * Updated styles for these components: `Input`, `TextArea` and `ButtonBase` now have no borders, outlines, and background color by default.
  * `CoreUIComposer` has been removed and the components are available as static exports.
  * The `InputFocusTracker`, `KeyChordManager`, and `LayeredFocusManager` should be configured through `CoreUIProvider` instead and the components will inherit from the context accordingly.

* Input Focus API:
  * Added new hook `useCommonFocusableRefHandler`.

* Added `isUndefinedOrNull` as a performance alternative to `isNullOrUndefined` where the values to check are expected to be `undefined` more often than `null`.
* Added `getPercentage`, `tryFormatAsClassName`, `compileCSSVariables`, `useClassName`, `CSSClassNameFactory`.

## 0.0.0-experimental.66
* `serializePixelValue` has been renamed to `normalizeCSSValue`

* Performance optimizations for `LayeredFocusManager`.
* `FocusLayer` now has a `ignoreSiblings?: boolean` prop that allows its child input elements to stay unaffected even when the layer does not have focus. This is useful for UI elements such as a toolbar that needs to remain always available.
* Each component tree now requires a `FocusRoot` for `FocusLayer` to function.

## 0.0.0-experimental.52

* Added `useLayoutCSSVariableInjection`.
* Added division helpers: `isEven`, `isOdd`, `isDivisibleBy`, `isDivisibleByN`
* Added CSS unit formatting functions for readability: `px`, `pt`, `em`, `rem`, `fr`, `vh`, `vw`, `vmin`, `vmax`, `percent`
* Added `DateTimeConverter`, a utility that allows converting data types between different date types.
* CoreUI components have been reverted back — they need to be created using `CoreUIComposer`.
* New CoreUI component: `Select`.
* Added HTML interactive element helpers: `DisabledContext`, `InputFocusTracker`, `LayeredFocusManager`

* Added `useMergedRefs` and `mergeRefs` for assigning one node to multiple ref objects.
* Added `useConstant` hook, which is similar to `useRef` except it is for immutable values.
* Added `useConstructor` hook, for lazily initializing values and have a cleanup effect run when the component unmounts. This is similar to the code below, except it is safe and stable even in `StrictMode`:
  ```ts
  // In this example, two expensive variables will be created, but because of
  // `StrictMode`, the first one will be inaccessible and the second one gets
  // disposed instead.
  function Example() {
    const someExpensiveVariable = useRef(null)
    if (!someExpensiveVariable.current) {
      someExpensiveVariable.current = new ExpensiveVariable()
    }

    }, [])
  }

    'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps': [Severity.WARN, {
      // If you already have existing configurations, you will need to
      // merge the values, example:
