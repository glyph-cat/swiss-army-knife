* `injectCSSVariables` now only appends `'px'` to number values smartly by using `autoPx`
* Added `useLayoutCSSVariableInjection`.
* Added division helpers: `isEven`, `isOdd`, `isDivisibleBy`, `isDivisibleByN`
* Added CSS unit formatting functions for readability: `px`, `pt`, `em`, `rem`, `fr`, `vh`, `vw`, `vmin`, `vmax`, `percent`
* Added `DateTimeConverter`, a utility that allows converting data types between different date types.
* CoreUI components have been reverted back — they need to be created using `CoreUIComposer`.
* New CoreUI component: `Select`.
* Added HTML interactive element helpers: `DisabledContext`, `InputFocusTracker`, `LayeredFocusManager`

  ```ts
  // In this example, two expensive variables will be created, but because of
  // `StrictMode`, the first one will be inaccessible and the second one gets
  // disposed instead.
  function Example() {
    const someExpensiveVariable = useRef(null)
    if (!someExpensiveVariable.current) {
      someExpensiveVariable.current = new ExpensiveVariable()
    }

      someExpensiveVariable.current.dispose()
    }, [])
  }
